      <div id=contents >
        <p>(<a href=https://github.com/mngz47/games/wiki/2048 >[2048]</a>) In this game, the player must combine tiles containing the same numbers until they reach the number 2048. The tiles can contain only integer values starting from 2, and that are a power of two, like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. Ideally, the player should reach the 2048 tile within the smallest number of steps.</p>
        <p>(<a href=https://github.com/mngz47/games/wiki/40963 >[40963]</a>) HOW TO PLAY: Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one! Play variations of the original 2048 game : 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768</p>
<p>(<a href=https://github.com/mngz47/games/wiki/attackonball >[Attack on ball]</a>) This is a very fun game! Used to play it when I was younger and only remembered it recently. Id love it if this game was updated. Best part about this game is that you can just play offline to pass time. Also a cool feature would be impossible mode where the balls can bounce off one another or something.</p>
<p>(<a href=https://github.com/mngz47/games/wiki/blockdown >[Block Down]</a>) In Block Down, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the uncleared lines reach the top of the playing field.</p>
<p>(<a href=https://github.com/mngz47/games/wiki/fallingbottletest >[Falling Bottle Test]</a>) Falling Bottle Challenge invites you to see if you can drop the spinning bottle without shattering it. The spinning bottle whirls between two desks and if you don’t drop it just right, the bottle will shatter and the game will end. The distance from the ground will change, but you still must drop the bottle at just the right time to gain a point. How many bottles can you drop perfectly? How many points will you get? Challenge yourself with this fun game.</p>
